Nft mp:
Nft is briefly owning an item on the blockchain it empowers you to put on 
audio, video , images on the blockchain and own them.
cuz they're rare kinda like owning monalisa in real world

As these nfts became more common and there started to be a lot of use cases 
for these nfts that's where people felt the need to connect the buyers and 
sellers of these nfts before that it was mostly over the ctr and then 
people were finding out the owners of those nfts and buying it but then 
there arose a need because there was a huge volumes that buyers and sellers
come together on a platform and exchange nfts which each other.
Make it super easy for buyers and sellers to connect find the right price at 
which they can transact and then proceed with the transaction execute it makes
it super simple.
A market that connects the buyers or sellers of an nft this mpl helps people 
find a price and then provides utilities for smooth transaction ulti this mpl
helps grow the pie for the entire nft market 

STRUCTURE OF NFT:
1 frontend

2 smart contract  -> the layer that interacts with the blockchain any nft which
is uploaded will be uploaded with the blockchain with the help of f(x) that are 
written in the smart contract. Piece of code which is crucial for the app that 
are interacting with our blockchain.

3 decenralized data storage -> ipfs - nfts datastore where we'll be uploading 
the nft metadata basically data bout our nfts incld the image,name , the desc  
and all other details 

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DEVELOP AN NFT MARKETPLACE:
- SOLIDITY  a smart contract backend i.e written which interacts with a blockchain is in solidity
blockchain: gurley testnet - testnet is on ethereum 

- A NODE - ALCHEMY  it is a node service provider like ALCHEMY so everytime you go ahead and deploy 
your smart contract to interact we'll int with the blockchain or we're going to upload an nft in which 
like you upl an nft an image right down the details you submit a price and then you hit sumbit when you do that
again you're interacting with the blockchain whenever you're int with the blockchain we need a node service provider 


- IPFS  - is decenralized storage we'll specifically be using the service called pinata 
it is a very easy to use ipfs frontfacing platform where we have a really nice interface 
to interact with ipfs.
IMP : cuz if you wanted to DEVELOP an nft MARKETPLACE you have all of the data that needs to 
be stored (images metadata bout images) rather than putting it onto ethereum use ipfs
it returns you a url (ipfs) which maps to all of your metadata.
Now that ipfs url is all we save on the blockchain having all the data elsewhere 
also keeping a mapping of data with a smart contract on the blockchain 

- A DEVELOPER WALLET LIKE METAMASK WITH CRYPTO ON IT  - i METAMASK and we'll also need to load it with testnet(gurley) eth 
to be able to run our transaction to be able to run our smart contract 

- A frontend WEBSITE - SOL which is a smart contract, node service which is ALCHEMY, using ipfs to actually store all of the data
for nfts, using METAMASK to actually you know pay for everything that you do on the blockchain to supp all of this you need a WEBSITE
You can go log in w/ your wallet actually go out upload an nft view those nfts 
on the MARKETPLACE and buy somebody else's nft.

TILL INT
